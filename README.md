# Solidity Contracts

> :warning: This repository contains my first attempts at writing Solidity contracts. Most of them are just meant to explore how Solidity works. Use everything at your own risk.

## Contracts

- [Greeter.sol](./contracts/Greeter.sol)\
Allows to set a name and get a greeting message.
- [CryptoWill.sol](./contracts/CryptoWill.sol)\
Allows the owner to store ether; if the owner does not check in within an interval, the stored ether can be claimed by a previously defined beneficiary.
